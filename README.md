# Red-Black Binary Search Tree
This is a custom implementation of a self-balancing red-black binary search tree, which I completed as part of my Designing Data Structures course. This was a particularly challenging assignment and required me to gain a deep understanding of how red-black trees work and how to balance them as nodes are added to the tree.

The code for the tree is in the `bst.h` file. The most notable method is the `balance()` method, which recursively balances the tree when a new node is inserted. This project, while difficult, was a ton of fun and greatly increased my understanding of binary search trees.
